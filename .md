/sp.plan   ## Create: functional specification, module-level design, CLI flow outline, and implementation checklist.

**Decisions needing documentation**: task ID strategy, class responsibilities, module boundaries, error-handling patterns.
**Testing strategy**: manual CLI testing against success criteria and feature checklist.

## Technical details:
- Follow top-down approach (define behavior before implementation)
- Organize by layers: CLI → Domain Models → In-Memory Store
- Implement incrementally by feature: Add → View → Update → Delete → Toggle Complete
- Validate quality against Constitution (OOP, simplicity, determinism, readability)
